## About the Open buildingSMART Community

This is a community-driven space where individuals, companies, and groups work on projects related to **openBIM** and **buildingSMART** standards. Our aim is to support the global adoption and advancement of openBIM by providing resources, tools, and collaboration opportunities. 

**Note:** This community hosts **independent** projects. While buildingSMART International supports our efforts in these repositories, the work here is entirely community-led and is **not officially owned** by bSI.

## Contributing to the Repositories

Each repository is maintained by its individual contributors, and ownership varies from project to project. All work is licensed independently, with different contributors defining terms and conditions as per each repository’s needs. 

When contributing, please review the license and guidelines of each specific repository to understand the terms of use, and respect the project’s maintainers and their decisions. We ask all contributors to follow these guidelines for a constructive and respectful experience.

### Guidelines for Contributing

1. **Respect Repository Ownership and Licenses**  
   - Each repository within the community is independently owned and may have a unique license. Before using or contributing to any repository, ensure you review and understand the repository’s license and contributor guidelines.
   
2. **Apply for a New Repository**  
   - If you have a project idea that aligns with openBIM and buildingSMART standards, we welcome your initiative! To apply for a new repository under this organization, please contact **technical@buildingsmart.org**. Your application will be reviewed to ensure it fits the openBIM mission and this community standards.
   
3. **Collaborate Constructively**  
   - This community is driven by mutual respect, shared goals, and collaboration. We ask all contributors to maintain a respectful tone, engage in constructive discussions, and adhere to any code of conduct specified by individual repositories.

4. **Reporting Issues**  
   - If you encounter a bug or have suggestions for improvement, create an issue in the relevant repository. Describe the issue in detail to help maintainers understand and address it efficiently.

5. **Pull Requests**  
   - To contribute code, submit a pull request (PR) with a clear explanation of your changes. Where applicable, include tests and follow any repository-specific contribution guidelines.

### Community Etiquette

- **Be Inclusive and Respectful**: We are a global community with a diversity of ideas and backgrounds. All contributors are encouraged to engage respectfully and value each other’s contributions.
